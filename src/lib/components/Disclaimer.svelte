  <strong>Please Note</strong>: The language used in these pieces comes directly
  from W.E.B. Du Bois' scientific study in 1900. 
  
  I hope this language serves as a powerful reminder that racial inequality has a
  long tenure in our societies and institutions.
  However, race is a difficult subject to navigate with appropriate awareness
  and compassion, especially for white people like myself. If you have any
  thoughts or feedback on how to better present this work,
