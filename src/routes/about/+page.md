[W.E.B. Du Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois) was a black American sociologist at the turn of the 20th century.
Through his academic work, he challenged the notions that black Americans were responsible for the prevailaing social inequities they were facing. 
He pioneered methods of data visualization to communicate this message clearly to scientists around the globe.
But this short summary cannot come close to describing the breadth of Du Bois' life and career, for that I would recommend checking the Wikipedia page linked above.

This website is a portfolio of W.E.B. Du Bois' data visualizations created with modern tools as part of the [2024 W.E.B. Du Bois challenge](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge/2024).
It is an attempt to develop my skills with the tools and theory of data visualization while drawing attention to the work of a hugely significant scientist.
